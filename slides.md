# Writing documentation ü§®

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Docs become quickly outdated

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Docs efforts are not usually scoped

---

# Introducing Docs-As-Code

 > Write docs with the same tools and workflows used to code.

- Lightweight Markup Language
- Integrated Development Environment
- Version Control
- Peer Reviews
- Testing
- CI / CD

---

# Why?

- Promote the collaboration between writers and developers.
- Incentivize devs to write about features while they are fresh.
- Achieve consistency between documents.
- Publish documentation in multiple formats.
- Faster docs releases.

# 1. Writing documentation

---

# Where docs should live?

- **Near the source code**.
  (+) Fits well in the development cycle.
  (+) Docs are part of the code.
  (-) Difficult to serve all docs together.
- **Separate repository**
  (+) All docs are in one central place.
  (-) Devs need to contribute in a separate repository.

---

## Markup language

-  Plain text with annotations to format the text.

- Generate multiple formats from raw text.

- HTML, Markdown, restructuredText, AsciiDoc, ...

## IDE

- VSCode, Sublime, Notepad, VIM ...

---

# restructuredText cheatsheet

-  ``**bold**``, ``*italic*``, `` `link <http://google.com>`_``

- Headings adornment: ``= - ` : . ' " ~ ^ _ * + #``
